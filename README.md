# 🚀 INTRODUCTION

---

The `cub3D` project at 42 school plunges students into the captivating realm of raycasting and 3D graphics rendering within the C language. This immersive endeavor challenges students to develop a rudimentary 3D game engine capable of rendering a textured maze in a two-dimensional plane.

Drawing inspiration from the iconic game Wolfenstein 3D, cub3D involves implementing raycasting techniques to simulate the rendering of three-dimensional environments in real-time. Students delve into the intricacies of vector mathematics, spatial geometry, and rendering algorithms to construct a visually compelling game world.

Beyond graphics rendering, the project delves into file parsing, user input handling, and interactive gameplay mechanics.

`cub3D` serves as a springboard for exploring the fusion of computer graphics and game development, empowering students to craft immersive experiences that push the boundaries of visual storytelling and interactive entertainment.

# 🛠️  Program Specificities and Considerations

> [!WARNING]
> This project aims to be executed in a x86 Linux environment, with a QWERTY keyboard.

Start with cloning my repo :
```bash
git clone git@github.com:jotudela/cub3D.git && cd cub3D
```

## ⚙️ Usage (mandatory)

Go to mandatory part :
```bash
cd mandatory
```

and compile the project :
```bash
make
```

Cub3D need to be executed with one argument.

Example :
```bash
./cub3D maps/test.cub
```

## 🎮 Controls
